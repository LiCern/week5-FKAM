At [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/about/) coding bootcamp we are tasked every week with a different project. A MVP is built in 1.5 days by 4 developers that follow the Agile methodology.

__Week 5__: PosgreSQL

## Install 
To install the project: 
1. Clone the project
2. Run `npm install` to setup package dependencies
3. Create local production database called whatever you like
4. Create a test database called mytestdatabase_week_5 with the same owner/user
5. Create a .env file in the project root
   PGDATABASE=local_production_database
   PGUSER=your_db_user
   PGPASSWORD=your_db_password
6. Run `npm run wipedb` to init or reset your production db
7. Run `npm test` to run tests
8. Run `npm start` to start

## Schemas
```javascript=
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  postcode VARCHAR(8)
);
```
```javascript=
CREATE TABLE category (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  category VARCHAR(20)
);
```
```javascript=
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,  
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  time TIMESTAMPTZ,
  category INTEGER,
  post TEXT NOT NULL,  
  user_id INTEGER
```

## User Stories
1. As a scared person in this pandemic I stocked up way too many stuff. I'd like a place where I can post about these surplus goods so people who are in need collect them.
2. As a person who didn't stock up in this pandemic and only finds empty shelves in the shops, I'd like a place to see what other people are giving away so I can find essentials.
3. As a person that can't find toilet paper in the shops, I'd like to limit my search so I can find what I need.
